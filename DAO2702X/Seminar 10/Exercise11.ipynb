    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are using Python program to create a \"Russian Roulette\" game, where one bullet is loaded in the chamber of a revolver, and the player is shooting himself in up to 6 rounds. If the player hits an empty shot, print the sound effect \"click\". If the player hit a lethal shot, then print \"Bang\" and terminate the game. The round of the lethal shot is determined by a random number, generated by the function `randint()` from the module \"numpy.random\". The help information of this function is given as follows.\n",
